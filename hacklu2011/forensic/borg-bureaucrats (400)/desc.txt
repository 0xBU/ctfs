Borg-Bureaucrats

> Received Federal Transmission: Greetings, the aggressions by the collective have reached a 
new quality, dozens of federal colonies in the Alpha and Beta Quadrant (rumors say even Psi,
 Lambda, Kappa, Theta and Upsilon Mad) have been assimilated the last days. We have a high 
suspicion that it is only a matter of time they will push for the centre of the Alpha Quadrant 
and finally planet earth. Their forces outnumber ours by far and basically there is no hope left.
 But... among those recently assimilated were a colony of German bureaucrats and despite their 
assimilation they still seem to have maintained a strong tendency of sticking to strange old 
habits and weird provisions. We were able to intercept some subspace COMmunication sent by those 
bureaucrat-drones and believe that, though containing VERY important information that will 
certainly turn the favors of war, it was encrypted using some strange pre-quantumn application 
from the turn of the last millenium. Shouldn't be much of a deal for you, just feed it to some 
quantumn-computer and save the free world. No need to REinvent the wheel here.
