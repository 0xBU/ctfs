Deathstar Escape

You are, Han Duo (Han Solo's not so well-known and misfortunate twin-brother) and want to 
escape from The Terminal-Disease Star. The ambition to outperform your brother made you hire 
an IT guy, to take care of your Trillenium Falcon. Turns out, he has installed some access 
control to prevent stormtroopers meddling with your default desktop wallpaper (white dots on 
a black background) Face your destiny: Escape the imperial troops! ...or do whatever
