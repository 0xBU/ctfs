Wipe out the Klingons

We already made it. The evil Klingons agression is nearly fended. But their final mothership is well protected 
and even sacrifing a huge number of battleships caused only minor damage. Spies told us an unclear message 
caused most technical operators and the commander to leave the ship. Unfortunately we are unable to locate them. 
We need your help to decrypt the secret message in order to blow these little bastards up. Due to our attacks 
their RNG got damaged. Our mole reported us they use a manually chosen seed increased by one every time 
as a workaround. nc ctf.hack.lu 2006
