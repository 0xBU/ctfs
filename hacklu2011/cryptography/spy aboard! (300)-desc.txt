Spy Aboard!

We have a spy aboard! For around 5 minutes ago we intercepted an encrypted transmission to an enemy outpost. 
It seems like we interrupted the mole in the act because we found an open transmission program on our terminals. 
We are 100% sure that he sent the position of our fleet to the outpost to plan an attack against us. Our position 
due the transmission was: position: Harcon System , Planet Crematoria , x: 129.23432231423 
degrees y: 111.13442353423 degrees , z: 100,13142234423 degrees We need the spies 
autorization code to prevent this attack. You as our crypto expert you have to find it! The survival 
of 10000 brave men, women and children depends on you!!! GOOD LUCK!
