FluxScience

Thanks to a former employee of FluxScience (one of our competitors), we managed to get hands on some 
important files which might help us revealing company secrets. Attached you will find the files. The 
employee who provided them got fired. You might be lucky and find his account still working: 

FLUX-38B273DD75860083-0B3DD6B02EC5B9B1-4AFFBAC2EB8B4D17 

He might not have the necessary permission to decrypt the personal data.
he stole them from his boss, _GLaDOS_. Would you mind helping us by finding their company secret?
