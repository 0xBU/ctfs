BorgBinary

When the Borg invaded the earth they assimilated cryptographic hash functions. 
But it occurres to you that they did not quite get the hang of their use in security.
 Fortunately they use them in their docking-controll systems. Break in, steal the key, 
and don't let them assimilate you. Resistance is not futile!
