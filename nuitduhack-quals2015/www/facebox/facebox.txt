faceBox
A shady company decided to write their own software for storing files in the cloud.

"No no no, this is OUR filebox. We decline any responsability in the usage of our filebox. In any event your files get lost, trashed, stolen or spy on : it's your fault, not ours."

You are investigating on the security of their cloud storage as it might have disastrous consequences if it were to get hacked by malicious actors.
