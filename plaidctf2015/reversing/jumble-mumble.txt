Reversing (200 pts)
My binary [jumble_mumble_7df06496932f57dbb7720b5763086be8.elf] seems to be a little bit jumbled! But I'm sure you can still recover the key...

tylerni7 is a terrible person, so md5sum your flag before submitting it.. (strip trailing 0s and md5sum lowercased input with no newline)
