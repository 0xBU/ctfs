You notice that the indicator light near the robotâ€™s antenna begins to blink. Perhaps the robot is connecting to a network? Using a wireless card and the network protocol analyzer Wireshark, you are able to create a PCAP file containing the packets sent over the network.

You suspect that the robot is communicating with the crashed ship. Your goal is to find the location of the ship by inspecting the network traffic.

You can perform the analysis online on Cloudshark[1] or you can download the PCAP file[2].

Hint:It may help to learn a bit about network communication on the Internet and Wireshark[3].
