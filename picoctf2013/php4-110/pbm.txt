It looks like our web administrators updated their MD5 code after the PHP3 fiasco. However, I still don't think they fixed all the bugs on this site[1].

Can you show them what they did wrong by logging in again?

Hint: They are still vulnerable to SQL injection. What can you do to make your code bypass all the checks?
