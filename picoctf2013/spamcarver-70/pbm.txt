While exploring an alien tomb, you find an ancient jpg of an ancient can of SPAM[1]. It seems valueless, but the guardbots really want it back, so perhaps there's something more here than meets the eye. Maybe it's cursed, or hexed, if you will?

Hint: As the name of the problem might suggest, you should look into file carving[2]
