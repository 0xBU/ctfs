ROP is a classic technique for getting around address randomization and non-executable memory. This sequence will teach you the basics.

Problem available on the shell machine in /problems/ROP_2_20f65dd0bcbe267d , downloadable here[1] with source here[2].

If you solve the problem you will be able to read the key file by running

    cat /problems/ROP_2_20f65dd0bcbe267d/key

    on the PicoCTF shell machine

    Hint: objdump -t can get you the address in memory of the string /bin/bash... and then you need to figure out how to pass it as an argument to a call to system somehow
