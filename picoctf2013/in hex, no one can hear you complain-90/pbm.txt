While flying through the outskirts of the Ripley system, you notice a distress signal from one of the outer moons. It appears a ship has crash-landed near a 16-sided pyramid. The lone survivor, a docx file[1], tells you that a malicious programmer has embedded an egg in his chest and he's afraid that it's going to hatch. He offers his assistance if you can help find the egg.

Hint: You should look at the first two bytes of the docx file, and then think about them a little bit...
